ÿÞThe idea here is to create registry entries that will
allow you to assign different sound events for different
program files. Here are the sequential steps.

1. "Browse" to select the desired .exe file. Say VB6.EXE
2. "Give it a friendly name in the "Application Name" text box. 
     Say 'Visual Basic 6'. This is the name that will appear in the
     "Sound Properties" Dialog box of the Control Panel.	
 3. Now check the checkboxes that you require. Eg. if
     you check the 'Open' check box you will be allowed 
     to enter the sound that will be played when the prog file
    is first opened. Similarly you can check the other boxes.
4. Click "Add".
5. Finally open the Control Panel -> Sounds and configure.

We are using the Cntrol Panel -> Sound instead of programming
direct to keep things simple and also allow you to save different schemes.

6. Press Clear to clear all the check marks (before proceeding with the next .exe file)

Good bye and good luck!
